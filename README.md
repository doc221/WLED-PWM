# CeilingLight based on WLED PWM
Original idea is https://github.com/thehookup/ESP32_Ceiling_Light, which I turned into a PCM.
PCB files are attached.
Als the override file to compile your own WLED binary.
Note that the ESP is a 30 pins ESP32 type C, aka HW-394 (https://github.com/doc221/images/HW-394.jpg) .
